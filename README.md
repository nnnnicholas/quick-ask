# quick-llm

`quick-llm` is the repo for `Quick Ask`, a compact macOS chat panel for short prompts.

The app lives above your other windows, keeps the input bar pinned while the conversation grows upward, reuses existing CLI logins instead of API keys, and can save transcripts with encrypted-at-rest storage.

## What It Does

- Toggle a floating panel with `Cmd+\`
- Open a separate history window with `Cmd+Shift+\`
- Start a fresh chat with `Cmd+N`
- Queue prompts while a reply is still streaming
- Steer to the next queued prompt with `Cmd+Enter`
- Cancel queued prompts without interrupting the current reply
- Steer or remove each queued prompt individually
- Restore earlier chats from encrypted saved history
- Show a small setup screen only when history is enabled but no archive folder has been chosen yet
- Pick your own archive folder or disable history entirely
- Switch between Claude via Claude CLI, ChatGPT via Codex CLI, Gemini via Gemini CLI, and installed Ollama models
- Recheck Claude, Codex, Gemini, and local-model availability from `Settings…`
- Hide or re-enable individual available models from `Settings…`

## Requirements

- macOS
- Python 3
- Xcode command line tools
- Any of: Claude CLI, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Ollama
- `openssl` and macOS Keychain access for transcript encryption

## Storage

Transcript saves are encrypted before they are written to disk.

- On first setup, Quick Ask asks whether history should be enabled.
- If history is enabled, Quick Ask saves into a `Quick Ask/sessions` subfolder inside the folder you choose.
- If history is disabled, Quick Ask does not save transcripts.
- The encryption key is stored in macOS Keychain under the service name `local-chat-transcript-key`.
- The app writes encrypted transcript files only. It does not write plaintext chat logs during normal use.
- You can still override the transcript folder with `QUICK_ASK_SAVE_DIR` or disable history with `QUICK_ASK_DISABLE_HISTORY=1`.

## Build

From the repo root:

```zsh
./build-quick-ask
```

That script:

- builds `Quick Ask.app`
- installs it into `~/Applications`
- bundles the Python backend and shared helper module
- installs a LaunchAgent so the app starts at login

## Usage

1. Launch Quick Ask.
2. If you want encrypted saved history, choose an archive folder in `Settings…`. If history is disabled, Quick Ask works without any archive setup.
3. If you want remote providers, make sure you have already logged in through the relevant CLI:
   - `claude auth login --claudeai`
   - `codex login --device-auth`
   - `gemini`
4. Press `Cmd+\` to show or hide the panel.
5. Type a prompt and press `Enter`.
6. Use the model menu to switch providers or open `Settings…`.
7. Press `Cmd+Shift+\` to browse and restore prior chats when history is enabled.
8. Press `Cmd+,` to open the real Quick Ask settings window.

If at least one provider or local model is already available, Quick Ask does not block you on provider setup. Provider status in `Settings…` is informational and reusable, not an API-key onboarding flow.

Model switching semantics:

- changing the selected model does not interrupt the reply already in flight
- the next submitted turn uses the newly selected model
- the current conversation history carries forward until you start a fresh chat

## Repo Notes

- Repo name: `quick-llm`
- GitHub: `nftstory/quick-llm`
- App name: `Quick Ask`

## Development

Run the UI suite with:

```zsh
python3 tests/test_quick_ask_ui.py -v
```

The UI tests do not send real chat prompts to Claude, Codex, Gemini, or Ollama. They run the app in a test mode with stubbed generation so layout, queueing, setup gating, history, and shortcut behavior can be verified without burning inference tokens.
